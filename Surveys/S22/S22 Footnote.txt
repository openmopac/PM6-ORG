<h3><a name="Calculation of Error">Worked</a> example of the calculation of the error in intermolecular interaction 
energies</h3>
<p align="left">The error in the PM7 prediction of the intermolecular interaction energy of a 
benzene molecule and a water molecule, entry &quot;17 benzene H2O&quot; in the table, can 
be calculated as follows:</p>
<p align="left">A MOPAC dataset was constructed using the geometry from the S22 CCSD(T)/CBS 
results<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; This <a href="17_benzene_H2O.mop">dataset</a> was run, and from the <a href="17_benzene_H2O.arc">archive file</a>
archive file the heat of 
formation was -37.4594 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. </p>
<p align="left">A second dataset was constructed in which the water molecule was moved far 
from the benzene molecule.&nbsp; This was done in two steps:<br>
(1) The system was converted into internal coordinates using a simple 
calculation, see <a href="step_1.mop">step_1.mop</a>.<br>
(2) The oxygen atom in the resulting geometry was moved far away from the 
benzene molecule.&nbsp; Because the hydrogen atoms on the water were in internal 
coordinates, the entire water molecule moved as well.</p>
<p align="left">The <a href="17_benzene_H2O_well_separated.mop">second dataset</a> was then run, and from the <a href="17_benzene_H2O_well_separated.arc">archive file</a> , the heat of 
formation was -34.6866 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p align="left">From these two results, the interaction energy for the water - benzene 
complex, predicted by PM7, was -2.7728 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>., so the error in 
PM7, when compared to the reference value of -3.28 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, is 0.51 kcal 
mol-1, in agreement with the value given in the table.</p>
