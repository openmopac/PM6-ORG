<TT>SET=<i>text</i></TT> </h1>
<p align="left">There are two ways to supply the list of reference data files to 
PARAM.&nbsp; If <TT>SET=&lt;text&gt;</TT> is present, then the file(s) represented by &lt;text&gt; will 
be used as the source of data file names.&nbsp; For example, <PRE>set= "../sets/All intermolecular interaction sets.txt"; &
     "../sets/Stand-alone core.txt" </PRE>
would select all the 
reference data-set files listed in the text-files &quot;All intermolecular interaction sets.txt&quot; 
and&nbsp; &quot;Stand-alone core.txt&quot; Text-files of this type contain the names of 
reference data-sets, less the &quot;.mop&quot;, e.g.:<PRE>Formaldehyde
benzene
Water
Ethane</PRE>
<p align="left">The alternative way of supplying reference data file names is to 
not use keyword <TT>SET</TT> and to put the file names after the PARAM data set line 
&quot;end&quot; This option should normally only be used in testing ideas.</p>
<p align="left">If there are any spaces in the file name, or in the 
path, then the path and text-file name must be delimited by quotation marks.</p>
