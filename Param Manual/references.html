File REFERENCES</h1>
<p align="left">
All references for reference data are stored in the file REFERENCES.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">
<b>Location:</b> This file must be in a specified folder, currently S:/utility/ 
(for Windows) or ~/M/utility/ (Linux and Mac). Alternatively, it can be in the 
directory that the job is being run in.</p>
<p align="left">
<b>Structure:</b> Each reference consists of four lines.&nbsp; The first line is 
the mnemonic.&nbsp; The next one, two, or three lines are the reference.&nbsp; 
If the reference does not extend to three lines, blank lines must be present, to 
ensure that the four lines are used.</p>
<p align="left">
<b>Mnemonic:</b> This can be up to 8 characters long.&nbsp; To avoid ambiguity, 
mnemonics should&nbsp; not be less than 7 characters. The mnemonic is composed 
of upper case letters and numbers, in any order.</p>
<p align="left">
<b>Reference:</b> These should be in the form suitable for reading.&nbsp; A good 
format would be as in a journal reference.&nbsp; Use existing references as a 
guide.</p>
<p align="left">
<b>Adding new references: </b>&nbsp;First, check that the reference does not 
already exist.&nbsp; Then create a new mnemonic, again make sure it is unique.&nbsp; 
Put the new reference at the end of the REFERENCES file.&nbsp; That way, if a 
mistake is made, it will not damage the other references.</p>
