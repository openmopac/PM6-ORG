<TT>CYCLES=<i>n</i></TT> </h1>
<p align="left">Run <i>n</i> complete cycles of parameter optimization, then 
stop.&nbsp; By default, parameter optimization will continue until the 
optimization criteria are met, or 600 complete cycles have been run.</p>
<p align="left">
<TT>CYCLES=<i>n</i></TT> is useful during the early stages of method 
development, when it's unlikely that the run would be completely successful.</p>
<p align="left">In most optimizations,
<TT>CYCLES=<i>n</i></TT> should not be used - monitor the optimization and stop 
it when it seems that it's going nowhere.</p>
