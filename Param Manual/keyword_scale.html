<TT>NOSCALE</TT></h1>
<p>During a parameter optimization, the effect on a calculated datum caused by 
changes in the parameters can be predicted.&nbsp; If the calculated change is 
very different to that predicted, the parameter optimization process might fail 
to converge.&nbsp; Most runs do not have any problems, and in a run that does 
have problems, normally only one or two data are involved.&nbsp; Rather than 
stop such a run, the weights of the offending data are automatically reduced.&nbsp; 
To prevent this automatic reduction in weights, add keyword <TT>NOSCALE</TT>.&nbsp;
<TT>NOSCALE</TT> on the PARAM keyword line affects all reference data.</p>
<p>An alternative, that prevents the weights of individual reference data files 
from being changed, is to have the word <tt>NOSCALE </tt>on the third line of individual 
reference data files.</p>
<TT>NOCALE</TT> does not affect normal data, that is, for normal data the 
default scaling faction is 1.0.&nbsp; For data that cause problems, when <TT>NOSCALE</TT> 
is not present the scaling factor decreases 
so as to reduce the impact of that data.&nbsp; If an individual datum stops causing 
problems, the scaling factor will increase to 1.0 again, for that datum.<p>&nbsp;</p>
