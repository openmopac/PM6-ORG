<h1 align="center">Strategies for using PARAM</h1>
<h3 align="left">Beginning</h3>
<p align="left">Before using PARAM for method development, first become familiar 
with the various utilities that are available. Then 
run a simple parameter optimization using PARAM.&nbsp; A good starting job would 
be <b><font color="#008000">Optimize-h.dat</font></b> in FILES.zip. Examine the 
output, to familiarize yourself with the process.&nbsp; Once the process is 
understood, make changes to the PARAM data set, and try out various ideas to 
test your understanding of the process.</p>
<p align="left">Also, before starting any parameter optimization work, decide 
what the objective is. Is it to develop a new, general purpose method, such as 
PM6 - that would be a large project taking at least a year. Or is it to develop 
a high-accuracy method such as <a href="../../Manual/rm1_key.html">RM1</a> that is 
limited to a few elements, or to a few molecular species, or to a specific set 
of bonds.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">If the objective is to develop a method for modeling a specific 
set of molecules, then the database would need to include examples of those 
systems.&nbsp; The default database (normal_data) is very small, only about 250 
files.&nbsp; During the development of PM6, the databases used consisted of over 
8,000 normal compounds, over 1,000 special cases, and about 380 atomic states.&nbsp; 
So the default database is obviously unlikely to have many molecules of 
interest.&nbsp; The first big task, then, is to assemble reference data for the 
species of interest, and to convert these data into reference data files.</p>
<p align="left">Use the default method, currently PM6, where possible, for both 
preliminary cleaning up of reference data set geometries and as a starting point 
for the values of parameters.</p>
<p align="left">For each data file constructed, first run it using MOPAC to get 
a good starting geometry.&nbsp; In the case of geometric references, set the 
optimization flags for the geometric references to zero during this operation.</p>
<p align="left">When a good set of reference data files are available, run a 
survey of them using PARAM (use <TT><a href="keyword_survey.html">SURVEY</a></TT>).&nbsp; 
This will allow any obvious errors to be quickly identified.&nbsp; Then run 
PARAM without <TT>SURVEY</TT> and without optimizing any parameters.&nbsp; The 
output file will allow more subtle errors to be detected. </p>
<p align="left">Parameter optimization is straightforward.&nbsp; To optimize all 
parameters for a given element, Ti for example, use (Ti)(all).&nbsp; To optimize 
several elements, separate the chemical symbols by spaces, e.g., (H C N O)(all).&nbsp; 
To optimize only some parameters, specify the parameters, either as (H C N 
O)(Uss betas zs) or as explicit entries:</p>
<p align="left">ZS&nbsp;&nbsp; H<br>
ZS&nbsp; C<br>
ZS&nbsp; N<br>
ZS&nbsp; O</p>
<p align="left">The style of specifying parameters is the same as that used in
<a href="../../Manual/external.html"><TT>EXTERNAL</TT></a>.&nbsp; If there is a 
need to constrain the values of parameters lower and upper bounds can be set, 
thus:</p>
<p align="left">ZS&nbsp; H 0.5 2.0<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">Intermediate</h3>
<p align="left">Rules</p>
<p align="left">Weak interactions: rules</p>
<p align="left"><b>Use of non-equilibrium structures</b></p>
<p align="left">Often there is insufficient information to pin down the surface 
of parameter space.&nbsp; In the case of the rare gases this can occur simply 
because there are few or no exemplars.&nbsp; When this occurs, one option is to 
use non-equilibrium structures.&nbsp; These are represented as reference data by 
rules.&nbsp; A typical example would be the difference in energy of the system 
at equilibrium and the system with a bond stretched or compressed.&nbsp; As 
systems of this type do not occur in nature, the best source of reference data 
is high-level calculation.&nbsp; In practice, diatomics are best.&nbsp; First, 
the geometry of the system is optimized,&nbsp; then the appropriate bond length 
is increased by 0.2<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;</font> then decreased by 0.2<font face="Times New Roman">&Aring;</font>.&nbsp; 
The results are used in the construction of three reference data files: the 
equilibrium, the stretched and the compressed forms.&nbsp; The geometries of all 
three reference data files are frozen.&nbsp; Rules are then constructed, 
relating the heat of formation of the stretched and compressed forms to that of 
the equilibrium form.</p>
<p align="left">Building sets of reference data files of this type is quite 
rapid.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Solids</b></p>
<p align="left">Inclusion of even one solid state system in a parameterization 
calculation would slow it down to such a degree that parameter optimization 
would be impossible.&nbsp; Instead, small aggregates can be used.&nbsp; Thus for 
the alkali metal halides, the tetrahedral system M<sub>4</sub>X<sub>4</sub> 
would be suitable.&nbsp; Its geometry could be obtained from high-level 
calculations.&nbsp; Likewise, the stability of such a system relative to four 
isolated MX dimers could be expressed as a rule.</p>

<h3 align="left">Advanced</h3>
<p align="left"><b>Methods that do not involve geometry optimization</b></p>
<p align="left">All general methods involve geometry optimization.&nbsp; Such 
methods are, of their nature, unsuitable for modeling many phenomena, such as 
activation barriers, electronic excited states, pKa, polarizabilities, etc.&nbsp; 
Methods for modeling these phenomena can be developed by using frozen 
geometries.&nbsp; The underlying idea is that geometries are optimized using one 
method, and the desired phenomenon then modeled using a different method.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">First, optimize all geometries using a well-defined method.&nbsp; 
This is easily done using PARAM keywords <a href="keyword_precise.html"><TT>PRECISE</TT></a> and <TT>
<a href="keyword_NEW_REF.html">NEW_REF</TT></a>. Then run parameter 
optimizations using PARAM keyword <a href="keyword_1SCF.html"><TT>1SCF</TT></a>.&nbsp; 
This prevents the geometries from changing during the parameterization. This 
allows the flexibility that was used for modeling geometries accurately to be 
used for the new phenomenon. </p>
<p align="left">A model example of this process would be to develop a method for 
predicting UV-Vis spectra.&nbsp; Only data relating to the desired phenomenon 
would be used, i.e., in the case of UV-Vis, this would consist of the named 
excited state of various molecules and the energies of the excitation. Only 
parameters that affect electronics need be optimized.&nbsp; This would exclude 
all nuclear terms, such as xfac, alpb, alp, fn11, etc.</p>
