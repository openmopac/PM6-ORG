<TT>LARGE</TT> </h1>
<p align="left">By default, the normal MOPAC output is suppressed.&nbsp; When 
<TT>LARGE</TT> is present, the normal MOPAC output is sent to the PARAM file 
&lt;text&gt;.arc.&nbsp; This output is useful in finding errors in the data sets.&nbsp; 
For example, if the heat of formation or the gradient on the first cycle of 
geometry optimization is very large, there is a possibility that the geometry is 
faulty.&nbsp; Also, if, in a system that is electronically simple, difficulties 
are reported in the SCF calculation, then the possibility of a faulty electronic 
state should be considered.&nbsp; This is particularly important in complicated 
organometallic systems such as heme.</p>
<p align="left">For more diagnostics when using 
<TT>LARGE</TT>, add ordinary MOPAC keywords such as <a href="../../Manual/pl.html">
PL</a> to the individual data set that's causing problems. </p>
