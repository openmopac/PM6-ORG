<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">MERGE combines survey tables of heats of formation, dipoles, 
etc., for various methods, to create HTML documents suitable for posting on the 
internet.&nbsp; The files created by MERGE allow easy comparison of different 
methods. MERGE should only be run when the appropriate survey tables exist.&nbsp; 
That is, MERGE should be run after:</p>
<p align="left">(a) Method development is complete, or almost complete.<br>
(b) Surveys have been done of the new method and appropriate older methods</p>
<h3 align="left">How to run MERGE</h3>
<p align="left">First, run surveys of the appropriate methods.&nbsp; Name each 
survey after the method, so if AM1 is to be surveyed, the data set used in the 
survey should be called am1.dat or AM1.dat.&nbsp; <br>
At the DOS prompt, go to the folder that contains the survey files.&nbsp; These 
files will have names that end in &quot;.geos&quot;, &quot;.heats&quot;, &quot;.ips&quot;, &quot;.dips&quot;.<br>
Assuming the surveys available are AM1, PM3, PM6, and new, use the command:<br>
C:&gt; MERGE AM1 PM3 PM6 NEW</p>
<p align="left">MERGE is very forgiving - if some data are missing, it will fill 
the appropriate cell with a space or a &quot;-&quot; symbol.</p>
<p align="left">References will be formatted to make them easy to read.</p>
