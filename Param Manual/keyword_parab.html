<TT>PARAB=<i>n.n</i></TT></h1>
<p>Ideally, parameter optimization proceeds by a set of steps in parameter 
space.&nbsp; The size and direction of these steps would be based on the 
gradients and local curvature of the parameter Hessian. Unfortunately however, 
the surface is so non-parabolic that a restraining force needs to be added.&nbsp; 
This limits the size of the steps. This restraining force adds a parabolic 
potential to the parameter space, with the parabola centered at the current 
values of the parameters.&nbsp; As the calculation proceeds, the size of this 
potential rises or falls, depending on the direction the parameters move in.&nbsp; 
If, on a given cycle, they move in more-or-less the same direction as in the 
previous cycle, then the restraining potential is too high, and it is decreased.&nbsp; 
Otherwise it is increased.</p>
<p>If
<TT>PARAB=<i>n.n</i></TT> is present, the default restraining potential, 10000, 
is replaced by<i> n.n,</i> and not changed during the optimization.</p>
