<TT>ALL</TT> </h1>

In parameter optimization, include reference data that are NOT to 
be optimized. The default is to exclude all data sets that do not contain any 
elements that are being optimized.</p>
<p align="left">
Sometimes, particularly when a reference function is used, a 
molecular species that would normally to be excluded from an optimization might 
need to be included.&nbsp; To allow for this, keyword <TT>ALL</TT> is provided. </p>

Example of the need for ALL</b></p>
<p align="left">
In a parameterization of boron, the set of reference data might 
include the energy of the BF<sub>3</sub>-PH<sub>3</sub> interaction.&nbsp; This 
could be represented as the heat of formation of BF<sub>3</sub>-PH<sub>3</sub> 
minus that of BF<sub>3</sub> and PH<sub>3</sub> as separate species.&nbsp; If 
<TT>ALL</TT> was not present, then PH<sub>3 </sub>would be automatically 
excluded, resulting in an error being reported.&nbsp; </p>
