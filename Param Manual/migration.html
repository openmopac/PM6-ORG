<h1 align="center">Migration to MOPAC</h1>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Parameters optimized using PARAM can be migrated for 
use in MOPAC.&nbsp; The simplest mechanism is to put the optimized parameters 
into a text file, <font color="#008000"><b>para.txt</b></font>, for example.&nbsp; Then, using the
<a href="../../Manual/external.html"><TT>EXTERNAL</TT></a> option with MOPAC, read in the 
values in that file.&nbsp; This would allow the full range of functionality of 
MOPAC to be used with the new method.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Eventually, there will be a need to make a permanent 
change to MOPAC, to allow the new method to be fully integrated into the 
program.&nbsp; This can be facilitated by use of an otherwise undocumented 
keyword, <TT>DEP</TT>.&nbsp; When a MOPAC job is run using <TT>DEP</TT> together with 
<TT>EXTERNAL=&lt;text&gt;</TT>, a unique file called <b><font color="#008000">
parameters_for_PM6_C.F90</font></b> will be created. This file can then be 
re-named and edited as necessary in order to show that it refers to the new 
method.</p>
<p align="left" dir="ltr">Obviously the MOPAC job to create this file does not 
need to be complicated.&nbsp; For example, the following file would be adequate 
for this task:</p>
<PRE>    DEP EXTERNAL=para.txt
      Create a FORTRAN-90 file containing parameters for the new method 
 
  H    0.00000000  0    0.0000000  0    0.0000000  0    0    0    0   </PRE></p>
