<h1 align="center">PARAM Utility: STATS</h1>
<p align="left">&nbsp;The STATS utility compares the accuracy of various methods. 
With the exception of the very early stages of method development, it is useful 
at all stages.&nbsp; As soon as a new method has reached the stage where it can 
be compared with existing methods, STATS can be run, and the comparison made. 
STATS calls the utilities STATISTICS (which does the hard work), and MERGE.</p>
<h3 align="left">How to use STATS</h3>
<p align="left">First, run surveys of the appropriate methods.&nbsp; Name each 
survey after the method, so if AM1 is to be surveyed, the data set used in the 
survey should be called am1.dat or AM1.dat.&nbsp; <br>
At the DOS prompt, go to the folder that contains the survey files.&nbsp; These 
files will have names that end in &quot;.geos&quot;, &quot;.heats&quot;, &quot;.ips&quot;, &quot;.dips&quot;.<br>
Assuming the surveys available are AM1, PM3, PM6, and new, use the command:<br>
C:&gt; STATS NEW AM1 PM3 PM6 </p>
<p align="left">STATS will then write the message:<br>
<TT>What elements? A blank, or 'All', or symbols of elements 
to be used,<br>
or 'NOT' followed by either 'TM' (to exclude transition metals)<br>
or by symbols of elements that are not to be used.)</TT></p>
<p align="left">Make the appropriate response.&nbsp; <br>
If statistics for all compounds of H, C, N, and O, only, are to be compared, 
then type in &quot;H C N O&quot;.<br>
If statistics for all compounds are to be compared, then don't type anything or 
type in the word &quot;ALL&quot;.<br>
If statistics for all compounds except those containing the halogens are to be 
compared, then&nbsp; type in &quot;NOT F Cl Br I&quot;<br>
If statistics for all compounds except those containing any transition metals 
are to be compared, then&nbsp; type in &quot;NOT TM&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Press &quot;return&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Several HTML windows will open - these give details of the 
statistical analyses. As an example, if PM6 and PM3 are compared for accuracy of 
prediction of heats of formation for compounds involving H C N and O, only, the 
table would like like this: </p>
                                                <h2 align="center">Average

                                                <p align="left">The color coding 
                                                allows relative accuracy of 
                                                methods to be compared. The 
                                                first method in the list, here 
                                                PM6, is used as the standard.&nbsp; 
                                                1154 compounds involving oxygen 
                                                (element 8) were used.&nbsp; For 
                                                PM6, the average unsigned error 
                                                was 4.61 kcal/mol.&nbsp; For 
                                                PM3, the average was 5.86 
                                                kcal/mol.&nbsp; In other words, 
                                                PM3 was not as accurate as PM6.&nbsp; 
                                                Where the accuracy is lower, the 
                                                number would be printed in <b>
                                                <font color="#FF0000">red</font></b>, 
                                                where it is higher, the number 
                                                would be in <b>
                                                <font color="#0000FF">blue</font></b>.</p>
<p align="left">The last two lines in the table summarize the statistics.&nbsp; 
&quot;All elements, avoiding double counting&quot; counts each system once only. Note that 
it is possible for the average unsigned error to exceed all of the average 
unsigned errors of the individual elements.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">&quot;Same as above, but with double counting&quot; counts each compound 
that contains hydrogen plus each that contains carbon, etc.&nbsp; In other 
words, if the statistics for H, C, N, and O were averaged. </p>
<p align="left">Up to four methods can be compared in any one run.&nbsp; 
Obviously the lowest number of methods that can be compared is two, but if only 
one method is used, a set of statistics can still be generated.</p>
