<TT>SURVEY (<a href="Param_Validation.zip">worked example</a>)</TT></h1>
<p align="left">When <TT>SURVEY</TT> is present, PARAM will run the supplied set of 
MOPAC reference data files, but, instead of optimizing parameters, a comparison 
of the calculated and reference data sets will be generated.&nbsp; The normal 
mode of operation is for each geometry to be optimized, then the calculated 
quantities and reference quantities printed to files.&nbsp; In addition to the 
&lt;file&gt;.out file, four main files are formed, these are:</p>
<p align="left">&lt;file&gt;.heats: A comparison of calculated and reference heats of 
formation.</p>
<p align="left">&lt;file&gt;.geos: A comparison of calculated and reference geometric 
quantities (bond lengths, angles and dihedrals)..</p>
<p align="left">&lt;file&gt;.ips: A comparison of calculated and reference ionization 
potentials.</p>
<p align="left">&lt;file&gt;.dips: A comparison of calculated and reference dipole 
moments.</p>
<p align="left">These files can then be used as data for generating tables 
comparing different methods, and for statistical analyses.</p>
<p align="left">Note: To make the &lt;file&gt;.geos file, the geometry is allowed to 
relax.&nbsp; This is different from a parameter optimization, where the 
gradients of the geometric reference data are used.</p>
