<TT>NEW_REF=&lt;<i>text</i>&gt;</TT></h1>
<p align="left">Normally reference data sets are not updated.&nbsp; This means 
that as a method gets more accurate, the geometries in reference data set files 
become less accurate than if the new method was used.&nbsp; To allow the 
geometries to be re-optimized using a new method, <TT>NEW_REF=&lt;<i>text</i>&gt;</TT> is provided.&nbsp; 
When a job is run using this keyword, new reference data sets are written to the 
location defined by &lt;<i>text</i>&gt;.&nbsp; Although in principle &lt;<i>text</i>&gt; can be the 
location of the current reference data set, that folder should not be used, because the 
current reference data sets will be over-written, and if a mistake is made it 
might be difficult to go back.</p>
<p align="left">If <TT>&nbsp;NEW_REF=&lt;<i>text</i>&gt;</TT> is used, only one <TT>
<a href="keyword_ref.html">REF</a></TT> 
folder should be defined.&nbsp; If more than one folder is specified, all the 
optimized files will still be written to the same folder, that is, the various 
sets would be combined.</p>
<p align="left"> <TT>NEW_REF=&lt;<i>text</i>&gt;</TT> is particularly useful 
when a method is finalized.&nbsp; The resulting files are optimized using that 
method, and would therefore run much faster in surveys.</p>
<p align="left"> If the folder name or the 
path contains spaces, then &lt;text&gt; should be delimited by quotation marks, as in:&nbsp;
<TT>NEW_REF=&quot;M:\Data\Improved normal data&quot; </TT></p>
