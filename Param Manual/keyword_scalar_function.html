Normally, heats of formation are defined relative to the elements in their 
standard state.&nbsp; But sometimes more subtle energies are involved, for 
example, the heat of formation of a hydrogen bond. The easiest way to allow 
these small energies to be properly represented is to make them functions.&nbsp; 
Thus the heat of formation of the hydrogen bond in water dimer can most easily 
be expressed as the heat of formation of the water dimer relative to two 
isolated water molecules.&nbsp; A highly accurate set of calculations has been 
done on water and its dimer, and the results can be used as reference data for 
the energy of the water-water interaction.&nbsp; The &quot;fact&quot; or reference datum 
here is the difference in energy of the most stable water dimer and the isolated 
water molecules.&nbsp; Therefore the geometries are not allowed to relax.&nbsp; 
For the water molecule, the HoF reference is HR=REF, a unique reference that 
indicates that this is not to be used as a reference function in parameter 
optimization, instead it is to be used only in building a rule.&nbsp; Here the 
rule is the definition of the hydrogen bond strength.:</p>

 Water dimer is also defined as a frozen geometry.&nbsp; Its heat of formation 
is defined as -5 kcal per mole plus two times the calculated heat of formation 
for the WATER_REF system.&nbsp; Now a very large HWT can be used.&nbsp; This 
increases the weight of the hydrogen bond, without affecting the weights of 
water or its dimer.<br>

<p>The relative energies of different configurations can be defined.&nbsp; In 
the article on water dimers, the energies of various dimers relative to the most 
stable dimer were reported.&nbsp; These, too, can be used as reference data.&nbsp; 
The reference file &quot;Water dimer Structure 0 (Non-planar open Cs)&quot;&nbsp; cannot 
be used, because its heat of formation is defined as a function, instead a new 
data set is created, &quot;water dimer structure 1 (non-planar open cs).mop&quot;:</p>

Now the energy difference of one water dimer compared to the most stable water 
dimer can be defined. Note that since the reference heat of formation is 
relative to that of a file that contains spaces, &quot;water dimer structure 1 (non-planar open cs).mop&quot; 
quotation marks are used, and also the relative weight is much larger than 
normal:&nbsp;
