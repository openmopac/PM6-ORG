Geometry references are defined by the symbols &lt;text&gt; and &lt;&gt;, and by the 
Z-matrix or geometry file.&nbsp; &lt;text&gt; defines a geometric variable, and 
the spacer &lt;&gt; 
defines a variable that is not a geometry reference.&nbsp; The geometry references are best described by 
examples.&nbsp; </p>

Consider ethylene.&nbsp; There are three quantities of interest, the C-C 
distance, the C-H distance and the C-C-H angle.&nbsp; The following MOPAC data 
set shows ethylene, defined using <a href="../../Manual/symmetry.html"><TT>SYMMETRY</TT></a>. 
In this case, the first three geometry data are marked for optimization.&nbsp; 
These data also correspond to the quantities of interest.&nbsp; If there is text 
between the &quot;&lt;&quot; and the &quot;&gt;&quot; symbols, the corresponding adjustable geometric 
parameter is defined as a geometric reference.&nbsp; So in this case, the first 
symbol is &quot;&lt;C-C&gt;&quot; and this corresponds to the geometric quantity 1.328 
&Aring;ngstroms, this being the C-C distance.&nbsp; The second reference, &quot;&lt;C-H&gt;&quot; 
corresponds to the distance 1.0809 &Aring;ngstroms, and the third &quot;&lt;C-C-H&gt;&quot; can be 
identified with the C-C-H angle of 123.509 degrees.</p>

Each geometric symbol corresponds to a geometric variable, in order.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h3>A more complicated example - Benzene, without symmetry </h3>
In this somewhat artificial example, there are exactly two geometric references, a C-C distance and a C-H distance.  The angles are defined by symmetry and are not marked for geometry optimization.  Only one C-C distance 
is important, the first C-C.&nbsp; This is indicated on the third line by 
&quot;&lt;C-C&gt;&quot;.&nbsp; (Line 1, with the MOPAC keyword
<a href="../../Manual/debug.html"><TT>DEBUG</TT></a>, would normally not have any keywords.&nbsp; 
<TT>DEBUG</TT> is here to show where Line 1 is.)&nbsp; The next four C-C distances, although marked for optimization, 
are not to be used as reference data in the parameterization&nbsp; To indicate 
that they are not to be used, four spacers, &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;, are present.&nbsp; The next 
datum, a C-H bond-length is to be used as a reference datum, so it is indicated 
by &quot;&lt;C-H&gt;&quot;.&nbsp; The rest of the geometry is not interesting, and can be 
ignored.
<p>What is written in the text block is up to the user - it is not used 
by PARAM, except that it must be at least one and less than 11 characters if it 
is to be used as a geometry reference.&nbsp; Don't use &quot;cute&quot; symbols in the 
text, such as &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot; - these will only confuse the program.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>How geometric data are used in a parameterization run</h3>
<p>At the start of a parameterization run, all reference data geometric 
quantities are re-defined as &quot;fixed&quot; - as if the optimization flag had been set 
to zero.&nbsp; The geometry is then optimized.&nbsp; In the case of ethylene 
(above), there would be no geometric variables, because all three geometric 
variables are also reference data, and would thus be &quot;fixed.&quot;&nbsp; In the case 
of benzene (above), there would be 9 geometric variables that would be 
optimized: 4 C-C distances and 5 C-H distances.&nbsp; When the geometry 
optimization is complete, the reference geometric data are re-defined as 
&quot;optimize&quot; - that is, the optimization flag are re-set to &quot;1&quot;.&nbsp; The 
gradient for each geometric datum is then calculated.&nbsp; If this is zero 
(never happens) then the method would, by definition, predict that geometric 
quantity with zero error.&nbsp; In practice, the gradient is non-zero, and is 
used as a measure of error for optimizing the parameters, in exactly the same 
way as the errors in the calculated heats of formation, dipole, and I.P. are 
used.</p>

<h3>How geometric data are used in a survey run</h3>
<p>In a survey, the reference geometric data are stored, and the geometry is 
then optimized.&nbsp; After the optimization is complete, the stored geometric 
data are compared with the calculated geometric data.&nbsp; The difference 
between the two (reference - calculated geometric quantity) is then a measure of 
the error in the calculated quantity.&nbsp; Note that in a survey, the reference 
data geometric parameters are not fixed, that is a parameterization run and a 
survey run are very different.</p>
