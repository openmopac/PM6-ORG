<p align="left">&nbsp;There are only three possible sources of error in 
semiempirical methods, and if these are eliminated, then semiempirical methods 
would be completely accurate.&nbsp; These sources of error are:</p>
<p align="left">(1) The reference data are inaccurate.<br>
(2) The underlying theory is faulty.<br>
(3) The parameter optimization is incomplete.</p>
<p align="left">Given a&nbsp; set of reference data, the program PARAM can 
optimize parameters for elements for use in semiempirical methods. Historically, 
this operation has been extremely difficult.&nbsp; As Dewar reported, the effort 
involved in developing the early methods such as MNDO and AM1 was enormous. Most 
of the time was spent optimizing parameters and eliminating artifacts. Problems 
of the type reported by Dewar have now been solved, and with the new PARAM, 
methods such as MNDO and AM1 can be developed in a matter of minutes or, at 
most, hours.</p>
<p align="left">Although parameter optimization is now fully automatic, a whole 
new set of problems must be addressed.&nbsp; Among these are:</p>
<p align="left">(A) Large data bases are needed in order to adequately represent 
all important chemical phenomena.<br>
(B) Efficient methods to manipulate these data sets are essential.<br>
(C) Techniques to determine absolute and relative accuracy of various methods 
are needed.<br>
(D) Migration from method development to production quality programs such as 
MOPAC must be facile.</p>
<p align="left">PARAM has been used three times thus far, for the development of 
PM3, to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; in MNDO, AM1, and PM3, and for the development of 
PM6.&nbsp; Of these, the development of PM6 could be considered as the most 
complete. </p>
